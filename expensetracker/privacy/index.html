            The status of the "Opt out of Interest-based Advertising" or "Opt out of Ads Personalization" 
            setting must be verified on each access of the ID.</ul>
        <ul><b>Association with personally-identifiable information or other identifiers.</b> The advertising 
            identifier must not be connected to personally-identifiable information or associated with any 
            persistent device identifier without explicit consent of the user.</ul>

    </p>

    <h1>Service Providers</h1>
    <p>
            We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service (“Service Providers”), 
            to provide the Service on our behalf, to perform Service-related services or to assist us in 
            analyzing how our Service is used.<br><br>

            These third parties have access to your Personal Data only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are 
            obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.<br><br>
    </p>

    <h3>Analytics and Crash Reporting</h3>
    We may use third-party Service Providers to monitor and analyze the use of our Service.<br><br>
    <b>Fabric</b> is a analytics tool that collect data about your activity in the expense tracker app. 
    We may use these information to improve our app by analyzing how our users are using the app. Also fabric 
    provide a tool 'Crashlytics' to track crashes in the app. This data helps us to improve our apps stability 
    and provide a cleaner experience to the user. Your data is covered by their 
    <a href="https://docs.fabric.io/android/fabric/data-privacy.html">privacy statement</a>.<br><br>
    <b>Firebase Analytics</b> is a product of google. Its purpose is same like fabric. We are using multiple tools 
        to track user activities in our app because this helps us validate data we are receiving. You can check 
        google privacy policy for this.

    <p><h3>Admob SDK from Google</h3>
        Expense Tracker is using Admob SDK to show ads. Now Admob may collect user information to do its work.  
        Google's advertising requirements can be summed up by Google’s Advertising Principles. They are put in place to provide a positive experience for users. <a href='https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/1316548?hl=en' target="_blank">https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/1316548?hl=en.</a>
            
        We use Google AdSense and Admob Advertising on our website and in our app.
        Google, as a third-party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our site. Google’s use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to our users based on previous visits to our site and other sites on the Internet. Users may opt-out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google Ad and Content Network privacy policy.
            
        We, along with third-party vendors such as Google use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookies) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) or other third-party identifiers together to compile data regarding user interactions with ad impressions and other ad service functions as they relate to our website.
            
        Google may use the advertising ID from the device on which the ad is serving to generate interests and demographics. Interests, demographics, and other data may be used to serve better targeted ads to the user. Additionally, personalized advertising (formerly known as interest-based advertising) are served via the Google Mobile Ads SDK.
    </p>

    <p>
        <p><h3>Authentication</h3></p>
        This app is using Firebase SDK along with Facebook and Google Authentication SDK for it's login functionality. 
        User may need to add email and password of facebook or google account or give access to facebook native app 
        to login in the app. But that is handled completely by these SDKs. Expense Tracker is not saving any user 
        account information in its scope. At this point, user data is covered by these privacy policies.
